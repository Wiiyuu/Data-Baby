# Calculus
## 1. Analogy
Derivative: Split patterns apart, like **X-rays**.  
Integral: Glue patterns together, like **Time-lapses**.

Calculus gives us two new options: split apart and glue together.  
It's a step-by-step view of the world.  

**Compare of X-Ray strategy**  
![X-Ray strategy](https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/calculus/course/xray-summary-table.png)  
To compare each X-Ray strategy:  
* With rings, steps increase steadily (upward sloping line)
* With slices, steps stay the same (flat line)
* With boards, steps get larger, peak, then get smaller (up and down)  
Therefore, the "ring-to-triangle" method tell us that the slices are increasing, and by the same amount each time (since the trend line is straight).
